## 🧾 Key Concepts  

### 🔹 Probability Basics  
- Probability of event A:  P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes)  

---

### 🔹 Conditional Probability  
- Conditional probability of A given B:  P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)  

---

### 🔹 Bayes Theorem  
- Formula:  P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)  

---

### 🔹 Law of Total Probability  
- Formula:  P(A) = Σ P(A|Bᵢ) * P(Bᵢ)  

---

### 🔹 Expectation & Variance  
- Expectation:  E[X] = (1/n) Σ xᵢ  
- Variance:  Var(X) = E[X²] − (E[X])²  
- Standard Deviation:  σ = √Var(X)  

---

### 🔹 Hypothesis Testing Recap  
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): Assumes no effect or difference.  
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Opposes H₀, suggests effect/difference exists.  
- p-value: Probability of observing data given H₀ is true.  
- Decision Rule: If p-value < α → Reject H₀.

- **Tasks:**  
  1. Probability analysis of events.  
  2. Conditional probabilities & Bayes theorem on features.  
  3. Hypothesis test on sample means.
