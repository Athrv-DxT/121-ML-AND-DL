# 🧠 121 Days of Machine Learning & Deep Learning  

Welcome to my **121-ML-AND-DL Challenge** — a self-paced journey where I aim to master the **fundamentals of Machine Learning & Deep Learning** by dedicating consistent effort every day. 🚀  

## 📌 Goal  
- Build a **strong foundation in math & ML theory**  
- Implement concepts in **Python**  

---

## ✅ Daily Workflow  
Each day will contain:  
- 📘 **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** → code    
- 📝 **Day README** → summary of that day’s topics
- 📝 **Notes** → Every 7th day of weekly learnings

---

## 📅 Progress Log  

- **Day 01** → Matrix fundamentals, linear algebra ops, solving equations, SVD 
- **Day 02** → Vector Norms, Vector Spaces and Subspaces, Orthogonality, Projections
- *(Will be updated daily)*  

---

## ⚡ Tech Stack  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow later)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub for documentation & version control
