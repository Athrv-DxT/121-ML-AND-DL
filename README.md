# 🧠 121 Days of Machine Learning & Deep Learning  

Welcome to my **121-ML-AND-DL Challenge** — a self-paced journey where I aim to master the **fundamentals of Machine Learning & Deep Learning** by dedicating consistent effort every day. 🚀  

## 📌 Goal  
- Build a **strong foundation in math & ML theory**  
- Implement concepts in **Python**  

---

## ✅ Daily Workflow  
Each day will contain:  
- 📘 **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** → code    
- 📝 **Day README** → summary of that day’s topics
- 📝 **Notes** → Every 7th day of weekly learnings
