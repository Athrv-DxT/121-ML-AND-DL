## 🧾 Key Concepts  

- **CI for Mean**:  CI = mean ± z * (σ/√n)  
- **CI for Proportion**:  CI = p ± z * √(p(1−p)/n)  
- **CI for Difference in Means**: CI = (mean₁ − mean₂) ± z * SE

## 🔹 Applications  
1. Estimate population parameters.  
2. Compare groups (e.g., Male vs Female bills).  
3. Assess reliability of sample statistics.
