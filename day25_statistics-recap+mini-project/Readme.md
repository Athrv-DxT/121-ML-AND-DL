# 📘 Day 25: Statistics Recap + Mini Project (Statistics + Linear Algebra)

## 📌 Agenda  
- Recap: Mean, Median, Variance, Confidence Intervals  
- Hypothesis Testing (t-test)  
- Correlation & Covariance  
- Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, SVD  
- Visualization & Insights

## 🧾 Key Concepts  

- **Mean**: Average value of data points.  
- **Variance**: Measure of spread.  
- **95% CI**: CI = mean ± z * (σ/√n)  
- **t-test**: Compare means of two groups.  
- **Correlation vs Covariance**:  
  - Correlation: Standardized relationship (-1 to 1)  
  - Covariance: Raw relationship (depends on units)  
- **Eigenvalues & SVD**: Dimensionality reduction & matrix decomposition tools.

## 🐍 Python Implementation  
- Calculated Mean, Variance, CI on real dataset  
- Performed t-test for Male vs Female bills  
- Computed correlation & covariance matrices  
- Applied Eigenvalue decomposition & SVD on covariance matrix  
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots & heatmaps
