## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Random Sampling  
A **sample** is a subset of the population.  
The mean of a sample is given by  

`XÌ„ = (1/n) * Î£ Xi`  

Larger sample sizes give better estimates of the population mean.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Sampling Distribution of the Mean  
If we take multiple samples of size `n`, the sample means form a distribution called the **Sampling Distribution**.  

- Mean of sample means â‰ˆ population mean `Î¼`  
- Standard Error (SE):  
`SE = Ïƒ / âˆšn`  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Central Limit Theorem (CLT)  
As the sample size `n â†’ âˆž`, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution:  

`XÌ„ ~ N( Î¼ , ÏƒÂ² / n )`  

This holds true even if the population distribution is not normal.

### ðŸ”¹ Law of Large Numbers (LLN)  
As the sample size `n â†’ âˆž`, the sample mean `XÌ„` converges to the true mean `Î¼`.
