# ðŸ“˜ Day 19: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Summary Statistics  

## ðŸ“Œ Agenda  
- Summary Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation)  
- Correlation Analysis (Pearson, Spearman)  
- Outlier Detection (IQR, Z-score)  
- Basic Data Visualization for EDA (Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps)  

---

## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Summary Statistics  
- Mean = (Sum of values) / (Number of values)  
- Median = Middle value when data is sorted  
- Mode = Most frequent value in the dataset  
- Variance = Average of squared differences from the mean  
- Standard Deviation = Square root of Variance  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Correlation Analysis  
- Pearson Correlation = Cov(X, Y) / (ÏƒX * ÏƒY)  
- Spearman Correlation = Pearson correlation applied on ranked data  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Outlier Detection  
- IQR = Q3 - Q1  
- Z-score = (X - Mean) / Standard Deviation  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization  
- Histogram â†’ Shows data distribution  
- Boxplot â†’ Highlights outliers using IQR  
- Heatmap â†’ Visualizes correlation between features
