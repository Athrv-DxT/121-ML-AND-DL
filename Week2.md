### ðŸ”¹ Day 9: Probability Theory & Rules
- **Probability Definition:** Likelihood of an event  
- **Rules:** Addition, Multiplication, Complement  

**Formulas:**  
- P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes  
- P(A âˆª B) = P(A) + P(B) âˆ’ P(A âˆ© B)  
- P(A âˆ© B) = P(A) Ã— P(B|A)  

**ML Applications:**  
- Probabilistic Models like Naive Bayes, Risk Modeling, Stochastic ML algorithms

### ðŸ”¹ Day 10: Conditional Probability & Bayes' Theorem
- **Conditional Probability:** Probability of A given B  

**Formulas:**  
- P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B)  
- Bayes' Theorem:  P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) Ã— P(A) ] / P(B)  

**ML Applications:**  
- Bayesian Networks, Spam Filtering, Medical Diagnosis

### ðŸ”¹ Day 11: Joint, Marginal & Conditional Distributions
- **Joint Distribution:** Probability of two events together  
- **Marginal Distribution:** Probability of one variable regardless of the other  
- **Conditional Distribution:** Probability given some conditions  

**Formulas:**  
- Joint: P(X, Y)  
- Marginal: P(X) = Î£ P(X,Y)  
- Conditional: P(X|Y) = P(X,Y) / P(Y)  

**ML Applications:**  
- Multivariate Models, HMMs, Probabilistic Graphical Models

### ðŸ”¹ Day 12: Expectation, Variance & Covariance
- **Expectation:** Mean of a random variable  
- **Variance:** Spread of a random variable  
- **Covariance:** Relationship between two variables  

**Formulas:**  
- E[X] = Î£ xáµ¢ Â· P(xáµ¢)  
- Var(X) = E[XÂ²] âˆ’ (E[X])Â²  
- Cov(X,Y) = E[(Xâˆ’E[X])(Yâˆ’E[Y])]  

**ML Applications:**  
- Feature Correlation, PCA, Portfolio Optimization

### ðŸ”¹ Day 13: Probability Basics â€“ Events & Simulations
- **Events:** Outcomes in probability space  
- **Simulations:** Monte Carlo simulations for approximations  

**Formulas:**  
- P(A) = |A| / |Sample Space|  
- Law of Large Numbers: As n â†’ âˆž, empirical probability â†’ true probability  

**ML Applications:**

### ðŸ”¹ Day 14: Random Variables & Distributions
- **Random Variables:** Discrete & Continuous RVs  
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** For discrete variables  
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** For continuous variables  

**Formulas:**  
- PMF:  P(X=x) = f(x),   Î£ f(x) = 1  
- PDF:  P(a â‰¤ X â‰¤ b) = âˆ«[a to b] f(x) dx  
- Expectation:  
  E[X] = Î£ x Â· P(X=x)   (Discrete)  
  E[X] = âˆ« x Â· f(x) dx   (Continuous)
