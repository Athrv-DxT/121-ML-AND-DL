# Day 31 â€“ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Topics Covered:
- Concept of KNN (Instance-based / Lazy Learning)  
- Euclidean Distance Formula  
- Role of `k` (bias-variance tradeoff)  
- Decision Boundary Intuition  
- Classification on Iris dataset  

## Key Formula:
Distance between two points:  
\[
d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_i - q_i)^2}
\]

## Mini Project:
- Apply KNN on the Iris dataset.  
- Train with different values of `k`.  
- Evaluate accuracy and visualize decision regions.
