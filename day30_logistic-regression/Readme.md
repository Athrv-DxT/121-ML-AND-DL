# ðŸ“˜ Day 30: Logistic Regression - Classification Basics + Coding

## ðŸ“Œ Agenda  
- Introduction to Classification  
- Logistic Regression fundamentals  
- Model Training & Predictions  
- Evaluation using Confusion Matrix & Metrics  

---

## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression  
- Used for classification problems (e.g., spam detection, disease diagnosis).  
- Predicts probabilities using the Sigmoid function: p = 1 / (1 + e^(-(b0 + b1*x)))  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions  
- Confusion Matrix for actual vs predicted values  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score for better performance analysis  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Applications in ML  
1. Email Spam Detection  
2. Cancer Detection  
3. Credit Risk Analysis  
4. Customer Churn Prediction
