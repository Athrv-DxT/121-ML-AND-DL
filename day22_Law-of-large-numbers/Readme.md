# ðŸ“˜ Day 22: Law of Large Numbers (LLN) + Simulations

## ðŸ“Œ Agenda  
- Understanding the Law of Large Numbers (LLN)  
- Strong vs Weak LLN  
- Mathematical representation  
- Simulations using multiple distributions (Normal, Uniform, Exponential)  
- Confidence intervals around sample means

## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Law of Large Numbers (LLN)
- **Concept:** As sample size â†’ âˆž, sample mean â†’ population mean.  
- **Formula:** lim(nâ†’âˆž) (1/n) Î£ Xáµ¢ = Î¼ (population mean)  

### ðŸ”¹ Types of LLN  
- **Weak LLN:** Convergence in probability  
- **Strong LLN:** Almost sure convergence  

### ðŸ”¹ Applications  
- Monte Carlo Simulations  
- Estimating parameters in statistics  
- Risk modeling in finance  
- Quality control in manufacturing

## ðŸ“Š Simulations
- Sample mean convergence for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions  
- 95% Confidence Intervals around sample means  
- Visualization of convergence behavior
