# ðŸ“˜ Day 23: Probability Distributions Advanced

## ðŸ“Œ Agenda  
- Chi-Square Distribution: Definition, applications, coding  
- t-Distribution: Definition, applications, coding  
- Visualizations for different degrees of freedom  
- Random sampling and histogram plots  

---

## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Chi-Square Distribution  
- **Definition:** Sum of squares of independent standard normal variables.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Hypothesis testing (Goodness-of-fit)  
  - Variance estimation  

### ðŸ”¹ t-Distribution  
- **Definition:** Distribution of standardized sample means when population variance is unknown.  
- **Applications:**  
  - t-tests (one-sample, two-sample)  
  - Confidence intervals for small samples

## ðŸ“Š Simulations & Coding
1. PDF plots for Chi-Square and t-Distributions with varying degrees of freedom  
2. Comparison of t-distribution with Standard Normal distribution  
3. Random sampling and histogram visualization
