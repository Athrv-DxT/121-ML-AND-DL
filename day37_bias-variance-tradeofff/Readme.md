# Day 37 – Bias-Variance Tradeoff

## 📌 Concepts Covered:
- **Bias and Variance in Machine Learning**
- **Understanding Underfitting and Overfitting**
- **Visualizing the Tradeoff Curve**

---

## 🧠 Bias and Variance

- **Bias** is the error from overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.  
- **Variance** is the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.  

**Expected Error Decomposition:**  
**E[(y - ŷ)²] = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error**

## 📈 Visualization of Bias-Variance Tradeoff

The tradeoff shows that:
- High bias → underfitting  
- High variance → overfitting  
- The sweet spot balances both to minimize total error  

---

## 🔍 Key Insight
As model complexity increases:
- Bias ↓
- Variance ↑  
Optimal model complexity achieves minimum total error.
