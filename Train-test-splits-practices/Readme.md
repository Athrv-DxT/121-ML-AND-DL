# Day 44 - Train-Test Splits (Best Practices)

In this notebook, I explored **train-test splitting** in machine learning using best practices to ensure reliable model evaluation.

### Covered Concepts:
- Stratified sampling for balanced class distribution  
- Reproducibility with `random_state`  
- Avoiding data leakage by splitting before preprocessing  
- Consistent model evaluation  

### Dataset Used:
- **Iris Dataset** (Real-world, multiclass classification)

### Libraries Used:
- pandas, numpy, sklearn

### Key Takeaway:
Properly splitting your data is essential for fair and unbiased model evaluation.
