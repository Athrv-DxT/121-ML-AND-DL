# Day 5: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  

## ðŸ“Œ Agenda  
- Introduction to SVD  
- SVD Mathematical Concept  
- Image Compression using SVD  
- Applications in Machine Learning  

## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Singular Value Decomposition  
- Breaks a matrix into three simpler matrices: one for data directions, one for data scaling, and one for transformations.  
- **Importance in ML:** Makes data easier to analyze, compress, and visualize.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ SVD for Image Compression  
- We keep only the most important parts of the image data while removing unnecessary details.  
- Helps save storage while maintaining image quality.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Visualization in SVD  
- We can see how using fewer singular values reduces image quality but saves space.  
- Shows the balance between compression and accuracy.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Applications in ML  
- **PCA Computation:** PCA uses SVD internally for dimensionality reduction.  
- **Noise Reduction:** Removes less important data features.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Used in collaborative filtering like movie recommendations.  
- **Text Analysis:** Helps in extracting key topics from large text datasets.
