## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Expectation (Mean)  
The expectation or mean of a random variable X is:  

E[X] = (1/n) Î£ xáµ¢  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Variance  
Variance measures the spread of the data around the mean.  

- Population Variance:  
  Var(X) = (1/n) Î£ (xáµ¢ âˆ’ Î¼)Â²  

- Sample Variance:  
  sÂ² = (1/(nâˆ’1)) Î£ (xáµ¢ âˆ’ xÌ„)Â²  

- Standard Deviation:  
  Ïƒ = âˆšVar(X)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Variance Using Expectation Formula  

Var(X) = E[XÂ²] âˆ’ (E[X])Â²  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Law of Large Numbers  

As the sample size n increases, the sample mean approaches the true mean:  

lim (n â†’ âˆž) (1/n) Î£ xáµ¢ = E[X]  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Discrete Random Variable Expectation  

For discrete values xáµ¢ with probabilities páµ¢:  

E[X] = Î£ xáµ¢ páµ¢  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Continuous Random Variable Expectation  

For a continuous PDF f(x):  

E[X] = âˆ« xÂ·f(x) dx over (âˆ’âˆž, âˆž)

## ðŸ”¹ Python Functions Used  

np.mean(data)               # Expectation
np.var(data)                # Variance (Population)
np.var(data, ddof=1)        # Variance (Sample) ddof= delta degrees of freedom
np.std(data)                # Standard Deviation
np.trapezoid(f, x)          # Numerical Integration for Continuous Expectation
