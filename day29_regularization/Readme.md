## Day 29: Regularization (L1 & L2)

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to **Regularization**
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds absolute value of coefficients as penalty term
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds square of coefficients as penalty term

### Steps:
1. Load California Housing Dataset
2. Train Lasso & Ridge Regression Models
3. Evaluate using MSE & R²
4. Visualize coefficients for comparison

### Key Points:
- Lasso → Feature selection (some coefficients shrink to zero)
- Ridge → Coefficients shrink but never become zero
