# 📘 Day 58 – Gradient Boosting Advanced (XGBoost)

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- Introduction to **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
- Training and tuning XGBoost classifier
- Model evaluation using metrics and visualizations
- Feature importance analysis

---

## 🧠 Concept Summary

**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library that:
- Is faster than traditional Gradient Boosting.
- Handles missing values efficiently.
- Regularizes models to prevent overfitting.

## ⚙️ Steps:
1. Load **Breast Cancer Dataset** from sklearn.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train an **XGBClassifier** with tuned hyperparameters.
4. Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Visualize feature importance.
