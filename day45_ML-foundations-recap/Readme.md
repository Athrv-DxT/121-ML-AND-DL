# 📘 Day 45 – ML Foundations Recap + Mini Project

### 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini-project serves as a recap of the core **Machine Learning Foundations**, combining all the essential steps from data preprocessing to evaluation — implemented on a real-world dataset.

---

## 📂 **Project Overview**

The goal is to build and evaluate models that can predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets`).

## ⚙️ **Key Concepts Covered**

- Data Loading & Exploration  
- Feature Scaling with `StandardScaler`  
- Train-Test Split (with Stratification)  
- Model Building:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
- Model Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Cross-Validation for Robustness  
- Feature Importance Visualization
