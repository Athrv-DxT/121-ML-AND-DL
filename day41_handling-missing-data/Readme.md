## ðŸ§¾ Key Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ What is Missing Data?
Missing data occurs when no value is stored for a variable in an observation.  
It can arise due to data entry errors, sensor failure, or incomplete surveys.

**Types of Missingness:**
1. **MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):** Missingness is independent of any variable.  
2. **MAR (Missing at Random):** Missingness depends on other observed variables.  
3. **MNAR (Missing Not at Random):** Missingness depends on the unobserved variable itself.

## ðŸ”¹ Visualizing Missing Data
Before imputing, itâ€™s crucial to **visualize missing patterns**.
